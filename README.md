# terragrunt_with_terraform
Terragrunt by gruntwork was built to improve the shortcomings around the Terraform for effectively managing the infrastructure code so that developers can use the same code without any kind of duplication by keeping the terraform code dry. Terragrunt not only helps you with managing your terraform workspaces effectively but it can also help you with multiple terraform modules, managing Terraform remote state, etc.
